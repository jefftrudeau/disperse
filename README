Enhanced client libraries for memcached.

 * Provides optional, configuration-enabled support for:
   * Replication among groups of memcached servers.
   * Persistence to generic datasources.
   * Partitioning of data to multiple tables within a datasource (e.g., disperse_data, disperse_lock, disperse_session)
   * Cache-based sessions (depending on language). 
 * Uses a shared XML configuration so that multiple languages can access cached data in the same manner, thus enabling support for hybrid (multi-language) software systems. 
 * Languages supported:
   * PHP 
 * Languages planned:
   * Java
   * Perl
   * Python
   * Ruby
 * Future features:
   * Support for multiple datasources (language-specific?) 

PHP Example:

  // include the library
  include('/path/to/disperse/disperse.php');

  // load default configuration file
  Disperse::initialize();
  // disperse can now optionally load any configuration file
  Disperse::initialize('/path/to/other/file.xml');

  // get reference to cache
  $cache =& CacheFactory::getInstance();

  // setup something to cache
  $value = 'here is some data that needs to be cached';

  // update item in cache
  $cache->set('some key', serialize($value));

  // library handles storage of key/value according to configuration
