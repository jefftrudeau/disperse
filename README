  Example:
    Use CacheFactory to access the cache, e.g.:
    
    // include the library
    include('/path/to/disperse/disperse.php');
    // get reference to cache
    $cache =& CacheFactory::getInstance();
    // setup something to cache
    $value = 'here is some data that needs to be cached';
    // update item in cache
    $cache->set('some key', serialize($value));
    // library handles storage of key/value according to configuration
